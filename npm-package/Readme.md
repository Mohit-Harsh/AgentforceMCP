# Agentforce MCP (STDIO Server)

**Agentforce MCP** is an **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** server that enables any MCP-compatible client (like **GitHub Copilot** or **Claude Desktop**) to connect directly with **Agentforce Agents** hosted on Salesforce.

This package bridges your local MCP client with the Salesforce Agentforce platform via **STDIO**. Once connected, your MCP client can query or perform actions through your configured Salesforce Agent ‚Äî all in real time.

## üí° Practical Example (Claude Desktop)

Below is a real example of the **Agentforce MCP server** working inside **Claude Desktop**, showing how Claude communicates with a Salesforce Agent via the MCP server:

> **User:** *"get account targets of Genepoint"*

The MCP server then sends this query to Salesforce, and the Agentforce Agent responds with structured insights:

> **Claude:**

```
The Copilot_for_Salesforce agent provided the following information about GenePoint‚Äôs account targets:

Account Targets for GenePoint:

1. Reduce delivery time by 30% through route optimization
   ‚Ä¢ Recommended action: Analyze current delivery routes and implement advanced routing software using real-time data.

2. Launch a new AI product line by the third quarter
   ‚Ä¢ Recommended action: Establish a clear timeline and allocate resources for timely development and launch.

These strategies focus on enhancing operational efficiency and market competitiveness for GenePoint.
```

This demonstrates how you can **query Salesforce data or agent-driven insights directly from your MCP client** without needing to log into Salesforce manually.

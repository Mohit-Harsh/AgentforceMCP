# üß© MCP Server for Agentforce Agent Integration

This repository contains an implementation of a **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server** that enables seamless connectivity between **any MCP client** and the **Agentforce Agent**.

The server leverages the **Agentforce Python SDK** to invoke and interact with the Agentforce Agent, allowing developers to integrate intelligent automation and AI-driven workflows directly into MCP-compatible environments.

---

## üöÄ Overview

The **MCP Server for Agentforce** acts as a bridge between your MCP client and Salesforce‚Äôs Agentforce Agent.
It provides a standardized interface for communication, authentication, and tool invocation through the MCP protocol.

### ‚ú® Key Features

* **MCP-compliant Server:** Connects effortlessly with any MCP-compatible client.
* **Agentforce SDK Integration:** Utilizes the official Python SDK to interact with Agentforce Agents.
* **Secure Authentication:** Uses Salesforce credentials via environment variables for safe access.
* **Plug-and-Play Setup:** Quick installation and configuration for local development or integration testing.

```bash
UNAME=<your_salesforce_username>
PASSWORD=<your_salesforce_password>
SECURITY_TOKEN=<your_salesforce_security_token>
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Do not share your `.env` file or commit it to version control.
> Keep your credentials secure.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üß† Running the MCP Server

### Start the MCP Inspector Server

To interact with and test the MCP tools, run:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
```

This launches the **MCP Inspector Server**, which allows you to visually inspect and interact with the MCP endpoints.

### Connect to the MCP Server

Once the inspector server is running:

1. Open the MCP Inspector UI in your browser.

2. Navigate to **Connect ‚Üí Add MCP Server**.

3. Enter the host URL as:

   ```
   https://localhost:8000/mcp
   ```

4. Click **Connect**.

### Test the MCP Tools

After connecting, navigate to the **Tools** tab in the MCP Inspector.
Here you can trigger, inspect, and validate the available MCP tools integrated with the Agentforce Agent.
